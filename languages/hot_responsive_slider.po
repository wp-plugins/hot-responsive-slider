"<h2>Instructions </h2><p>The plugin settings can be accessed from Settings "
"&gt; Hot Responsive Slider. Each parameter is explained in this page.</"
"p><p>To insert slider into your post or page, use this shortcode: <code>"
"{slider}path/to/images{/slider}</code>. The path should be entered relative "
"to your WordPress site, in example: <code>{slider}wp-content/uploads/2015/01"
"{/slider}</code>.</p><p>Images that you uploaded through WordPress Media "
"Library are located in <code>wp-content/uploads</code> folder of your site. "
"There you can see many subfolders, usually per year and month when images "
"are uploaded. So, to include images from January 2015, the folder is "
"<code>wp-content/uploads/2015/01</code>.</p><p>You can also upload images "
"using FTP into any folder of your site. In this case, the uploaded image "
"will not be included in Media Library.</p><p>It is recommended to include "
"images with identical resolution (width and height) into the slider "
"instance. Slider can show the images with different resolutions though.</p>"
