Hot Responsive Slider allows you to create responsive, touch-friendly image sliders and insert them easily into your posts with shortcodes.

== Description ==

Image sliders are recommended when you need to include multiple pictures on a post or product page. Including them all in a "normal" way could damage visual appearance of your site and make it looks messy. Therefore, only one place for image slider with dozens of your images could illustrate your text or products you are selling in a better way. This approach is highly recommeded and often used in modern web design practices.

Hot Responsive Slider by [HotThemes](http://hot-themes.com/ "HotThemes") is based on jQuery. The sliders you create will look great on mobile devices and they will fit into the screen automatically. Furthermore, on all touch-screens user can change images with finger gestures, such as swiping or tapping.

== Installation ==

1. Install plugin as usually from WordPress.org. You can also manually download it, unpack and upload `plugin_hot_responsive_slider` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. To access the plugin's settings, go to Settings > Hot Responsive Slider. There you can set many paramters of the slider, such as animation and control paramters. Each parameter is described on this page.
4. To insert the slider into your posts, you can use shortcode: {slider}path/to/images{/slider}. The slider will use the common plugin's settings and show the images from the folder specified in the shortcode. Folder of the images should be given relatively to your WordPress site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to upload images? =

You can use any FTP client to create folders and upload images to your site.

= Can this plugin show images uploaded by Media Library? =

Yes, but you should know the folder where these images are uploaded. By default, WordPress makes folders with years and months. So, to show images from January 2015, your shortcode will be {slider}wp-content/uploads/2015/01{/slider}.

= I don't see any images, why? =

You most likely missed the folder where your images are stored. Use any FTP client to check the correct path of your images. Enter path relatively to your WordPress site (don't enter "http://" or "www.site.com" before folder).
